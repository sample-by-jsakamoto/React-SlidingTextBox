# Sliding TextBox Demo

A demonstration of smooth scrolling implementation to improve readability in translation subtitle systems.

When new text is added, typical implementations cause existing text to jump abruptly, making it difficult to read. The SlidingTextBox component solves this problem with smooth animation display.

**Left (Normal)**: Abrupt scrolling  
**Right (Sliding)**: Smooth slide-in animation
